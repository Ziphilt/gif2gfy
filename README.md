# Gif2gfy

An FFmpeg frontend for converting gifs into standalone gfy files.

## What is a gfy?

[As coined by Gfycat:](https://gfycat.com/about#gfy)

    A gfy is a short, looped, soundless video moment that includes GIF as one
    of the available formats.

    The name stands for "GIF Format Yoker" (we pronounce it "jiffy"). And the
    purpose is to bridge the gap between gif and html5 video by providing
    both-- allowing users much faster delivery, and more playback options

## Goals of this project

One particular shortcoming of Gfycat's gfy format is not being able to be saved
to the desktop and shared as a single file, which is an advantage gif has
enjoyed since its inception in 1987.

Gif2gfy overcomes Gfycat's lack of desktop support by distilling the essence of
the gfy format, i.e., a looping video, and putting it into a self-contained
HTML5 container for easy saving.

The ultimate goal of this project is to become redundant with the advent of
proper replacements for the gif format. In the meantime, this project serves as
a stopgap solution so that users can benefit from much smaller and smoother
animations.
