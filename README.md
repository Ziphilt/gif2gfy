## What is a gfy?

[As coined by Gfycat:](https://gfycat.com/about#gfy)

    A gfy is a short, looped, soundless video moment that includes GIF as one of the available formats.

    The name stands for "GIF Format Yoker" (we pronounce it "jiffy"). And the purpose is to bridge the gap between gif and html5 video by providing both-- allowing users much faster delivery, and more playback options
